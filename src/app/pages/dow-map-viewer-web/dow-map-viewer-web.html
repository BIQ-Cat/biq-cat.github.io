  Dow Map Viewer is a tool for visualizing maps from Dawn of War. It uses reverse-engineered data
  from the game, so it does not require original game to function. This application simplifies the
  process of designing strategies for Dawn of War: in original game, the process of viewing a map
  outside of a battle is quite time-consuming and complicated. Dow Map Viewer makes the process of
  designing strategies for Dawn of War much easier, which can help both new and experienced players.
  <br />
  The engine is written in Go and compiled to WebAssembly. It uses voxel graphics to render the map
  because it is fast and simple. All information about the map is parsed from the game's files, but
  you will have to upload the map files yourself. There are two popular built-in maps you can use,
  though.
